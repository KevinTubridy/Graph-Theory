# Graph-Theory
Graph Theory Repeat
# G00368158

# Description
In this repsoitory i will be using python to show on jupyter notebooks a number of questions in which i have answered. There will be two notebooks showing the answers for both sets of questions. 

**Executing program**

To run the application: Have python installed and set up on the machine. Clone the repo to your machine - git clone ( https://github.com/KevinTubridy/Graph_Theory ). Once the Repo has been cloned ls into the repo. cd into the project In Debian enter in python3 reg.py to see results

Have a script editor such as Visual Studio/Vs code.


# Questions that need to be answered:

**Heap SortNotebook**

• Explanation of what a rooted binary tree is.

• Overview of how the heap sort algorithm works, with reference to trees.

• Python function implementing Heap Sort.

• Explanation why, in the worst case, heap sort is more efficient than bubble sort.

**Graph Isomorphism Problem Notebook**

• Definition of graph isomorphism.

• Specification of the Graph Isomorphism Problem.

• Python function to determine whether two graphs are isomorphic.

• Explanation of the main reason computer scientists are interested in the complexity of the Graph Isomorphism Problem.
