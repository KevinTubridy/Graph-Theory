# Description
In this repsoitory i will be using python to show on jupyter notebooks a number of questions in which i have answered. There will be two notebooks showing the answers for both sets of questions. 

**Executing program**

To run the application: Have python installed and set up on the machine. Clone the repo to your machine - git clone ( https://github.com/KevinTubridy/Graph_Theory ). Once the Repo has been cloned ls into the repo. cd into the project In Debian enter in python3 reg.py to see results

Have a script editor such as Visual Studio/Vs code.


# Questions that need to be answered:

**Heap SortNotebook**

• Explanation of what a rooted binary tree is.

ANSWER

A binary tree is a rooted tree that is also an ordered tree (a.k.a. plane tree) in which every node has at most two children. A rooted tree naturally imparts a notion of levels (distance from the root), thus for every node a notion of children may be defined as the nodes connected to it a level below

• Overview of how the heap sort algorithm works, with reference to trees.

• Python function implementing Heap Sort.

• Explanation why, in the worst case, heap sort is more efficient than bubble sort.

**Graph Isomorphism Problem Notebook**

• Definition of graph isomorphism.
ANSWER
n graph theory, an isomorphism of graphs G and H is a bijection between the vertex sets of G and H

f
:
V
(
G
)
→
V
(
H
)
{\displaystyle f\colon V(G)\to V(H)}
such that any two vertices u and v of G are adjacent in G if and only if 
f
(
u
)
f(u) and 
f
(
v
)
f(v) are adjacent in H. This kind of bijection is commonly described as "edge-preserving bijection", in accordance with the general notion of isomorphism being a structure-preserving bijection. If an isomorphism exists between two graphs, then the graphs are called isomorphic and denoted as 
G
≃
H
G\simeq H. In the case when the bijection is a mapping of a graph onto itself

• Specification of the Graph Isomorphism Problem.

• Python function to determine whether two graphs are isomorphic.

• Explanation of the main reason computer scientists are interested in the complexity of the Graph Isomorphism Problem.
